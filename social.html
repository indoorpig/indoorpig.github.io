          I was first interested in the role of human recognition of spatial orientation and navigation to aid mental models. I applied this to a theoretical friend-finding platform after hearing about difficulties from friends with socializing in new cities after moving.

          From a product view, I investigated inherent difficulties with existing apps like usersâ€™ mixed motives and apathy. This informed implementation of features like 24 hour time limits and focusing choice to better incentivize action.
        </div>
        <div class=one-photo-right>
          <img src="social3.png"/>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class=new-story-block>
        <div class=one-photo-left>
          <img src="social5.png" />
        </div>
        <div class=text-block-right>
          Moving away from traditional tabbed layouts, I explored a more uncommon layout in which each major functionality sat on the highest row of pages while subsequent pages flowed downwards. As a result, function and space are interconnected: functions are mapped left-right, depth mapped up-down.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class=new-story-block>
        <div class=text-block-left>
          Designing for both first use and 10,00th use was a test in removing as much as possible while emphasizing functionality - for example, entering a different mode (edit profile function) by holding down content blocks instead of creating additional digital artifacts.
        </div>
        <div class=one-photo-right>
          <img src="social7.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class=new-story-block>
        <div class=one-photo-left>
          <img src="social6.png" />
        </div>
        <div class=text-block-right>
          This meant the app was holistically designed for quick use to facilitate connection and lead to actual face-to-face interactions - in other words, to get users off the app as quickly as possible and to be actively social.
