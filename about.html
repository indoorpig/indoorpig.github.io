      <div class=about-description>
        My interest in design is in empowering others while creating positive social change. For me, it’s all about finding the through-line by communication.

      <div class=about-description>
        I’m also really into music, powerlifting, photography, words, and food. Living between worlds is where I’ve learned the most about myself and the people around me. Also, I love to eat.
