              We started with a simple idea: what if Mercedes-Benz could help you get out your door in the morning
              faster - before even getting to your car?
              <br><br>
              In the face of ubiquitous rideshare and mobility options, we had to move past cars; we had to re-learn how
              users got from place to place.

              Mobility was a transition between places, and our hypothesis was simple.

              People need help leaving home in the morning.
              <br><br>
              We confirmed through research users had too much to worry about in a short period. Naturally, users
              compromised by only completing some tasks, rarely getting everything done.

          <br><br>
          <p>
            We proposed an unobtrusive assistant to anticipate and execute tasks centered around context-sensitive triggers.
            <br><br>
            There were 4 prinicples based from research:
            <ol>
              <li>High extraneous cognitive load meant the solution had to have simple interactions.</li>
              <li>The system must reach out first to capture user attention.</li>
              <li>System prompts must occur within a window of context-sensitivity to be perceived as helpful.</li>
              <li>System prompts outside this window were perceived as bothersome.</li>
            </ol>

              The Approach

            <p>
              Get testable wireframes ASAP and on the eyeballs of users, on whiteboards or lo-fi. With only one week, I
              had to gather actionable feedback and iterate — fast.

            <p>
              The idea was that users would share tasks they needed completing. The product processes that task at the
              right time and provides a solution.
              <br><br>
              Visually expressed, tasks took the form of cards. Until needed, cards were archived. When the time came
              for a task to be completed, its card resurfaced — with yes or no actions.
              <br><br>
              Breaking this down, that meant there were two main challenges to be solved:
              <ol>
                <li>Creating Moves (tasks) to be done.</li>
                <li>Activating created Moves at a specific time.</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
              First up: easing task creation.
              <br><br>
              Ideally, events are imported from native iOS/Google calendars and translated into possible action items.
              One setting, one permission, no manual input for all future events.
              <br><br>
              Though not ideal, in-app touchpoints needed work. Creating one-off tasks, no matter how streamlined,
              conflicted with research insights. As a result, recurring events were heavily pushed.
              <br><br>

              Once created, Moves took the form of cards. Together, cards comprised a feed. Lists were stressful, but a
              stack of cards could be acted on or swiped past; ignored or circled back to.
              <br><br>
              To limit cognitive load, Moves were hidden until action was required.
            </p>

          </div>

          <!-- Users’ threshold for what they were willing to do in the morning was extremely low. Users lose interest if
              the system:
              <ul>
                <li>prompted too often</li>
                <li>asked users to do too much at once</li>
                <li>took too much time to complete</li>
              </ul>
              Each morning, users had a list of to-do tasks. Organizing a feed of Moves meant deciding how they were
              displayed and changed the nature of the interaction. Users saw lists as intimidating first thing in the
              morning. Instead, the metaphor of cards were seen as “more friendly.”
              <br><br>
              A feed of cards were swiped left and right. Each card is completely ignore-able to further lower the
              cognitive load. Each card featured limited (max of 2), self-contained actions for a task.
              <br><br>
              Cards only showed up when it required user input. Otherwise, Moves were hidden in the main feed but
              scheduled. New Moves are created by swiping to the left.

              Next up: triggers, or how and when tasks activate.
              <br><br>
              Data supplied to create Moves was now used for requests. As a demo, my teammate remotely scheduled,
              started, and pre-heated a C300 equipped with Mercedes Me.
              <br><br>
              The same underpinnings allowed for reminders, traffic alerts and ETAs, and third-party services (e.g.
              hailing an Uber). And with provided time, services could be effectively account for wait times.

          <!-- Next, I needed to simplify triggers — how and when tasks would activate.
          <br><br>
          Timing was essential. Prompts during the right window was perceived as helpful - anything outside of that
          was annoyance. But having users determine that window meant higher cognitive loads.
          <br><br>
          Instead, I created two windows for tasks: morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) tasks, limiting user
          decisionm-making.
          <br><br>
          Users can’t create Moves more than a half-day in advance: this was intentional to create faster,
          on-the-fly interactions.
          <br><br>
          What we called "Leave Times" solved exact timing issues. Every AM or PM, a card asks when users plan to
          leave. This determines the exact time of Moves activate.
          <br><br>
          By breaking apart time calculation into two distinct streamlined interactions, we lowered the mental
          calculus for users.

            <br><br>
            <p>
              With an evaluation-ready wireframe, I tested prototypes with eight users.
              <br><br>
              Concerns of navigation and basic IA were apparent — but these were actually easy changes. Two
              interesting problems came with Move creation and interactions within the card feed.
              <br><br>
              Creating a single Move was like filling out a form.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="full-post-width content-1170 center-relative">

            <p>
              <br><br>
              There were too many options. Setting time was the main culprit; leaving users to decide the timing of
              events in context was too much of a strain.
              <br><br>
              Just as important, there was a fundamental disconnect between this form-like input and the resulting card
              output. The visual representation itself made it difficult for users to make connections in what they were
              doing.
              <br><br>
              Meanwhile, the feed had major interaction issues.

              Discoverability was a major issue. While the original intent was to remove as much extraneous information
              as possible, too little information meant users couldn't find status updates — even on demand.

              To finish my quick, 1-week prototype, I focused on small details and nudges.
              <br><br>
              For example, completing all Moves and clearing the feed rewarded a micro-interaction of completing the
              day’s tasks. This touch was received well with users who felt delight in accomplishing something while on
              the move.
              <br><br>
              I also included an alternative PM color scheme helped visually distinguish the trigger selection. This
              also helped create a distinct micro-interaction during the Move creation process.
