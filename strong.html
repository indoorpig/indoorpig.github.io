        Telling a story through a rapid one week design of an interactive product prototype.

          I chose to create a timer and interactions catered towards powerlifting use but my first task was creating a basic working model prototype by translating user actions (basic strength training programming) to a logical framework and coding it.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class=new-story-block>
        <div class=text-block-left>
          Then I considered the interactions themselves - the visceral slamming of a button versus a calculated press meant that simple adjustments to default sensor components like creating a larger surface area for buttons created a better experience for my user.

        <div class=one-photo-right>
          <img src="strong7.jpg"/>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class=new-story-block>
        <div class=one-photo-left>
          <img src="strong6.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class=text-block-right>
          I also knew the physical design of my product had to account for assembly and its components, so I included small features like wire management.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class=new-story-block>
        <div class=text-block-left>
          For the display, I decided to use edge lighting. In addition the laser etching, I also made some small adjustments with an X-acto knife to get the lighting even brighter. Ultimately with more focused and brighter LEDs along with more refined acrylic edges, the effect couldâ€™ve been even more pronounced.

        <div class=one-photo-right>
          <img src="strong3.gif" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class=new-story-block>
        <div class=one-photo-left>
          <img src="strong4.png" />
        </div>
        <div class=text-block-right>
          Given more time, my first priority would have been better form development - while the box clearly embodied the stability, how could I better translate the story through form or could it be embedded in a powerlifting belt?
