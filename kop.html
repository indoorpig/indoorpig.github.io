          We began working with local Atlanta popsicle maker, King of Pops (KoP), through in-depth personal research. We shadowed popsicle sellers (affectionately called “slingers”), toured their facilities, conducted semi-structured and informal interviews, and dissected their corporate brand.

        <div class=text-block-left>
          We created journey maps, identifying pain points, gain points, and potential opportunities to improve customer experiences. Our team focused on improving slinger resources and support, the front-facing side of the brand and essential to KoP.

        After synthesizing our research insights in presentations to our client, we ideated concepts that were in-line with their values - creating sketches and storyboards.

          We prototyped and presented a line of new sustainable products that streamlined a more holistic process than existing, disjointed solutions while enhancing the slinger experience to better represent their brand.
