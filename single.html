              Mercedes-Benz’s future vision revolves around CASE — Connected, Autonomous, Shared Services,
              Electric.
              <br><br>
              Our Innovation team was tasked with finding a digital product use for hardware within select
              models. We were not given a specific user or problem.

              We had a timeline of 3 weeks to create an MVP. The concept would be a success if approved and
              funded by a GM to continue product development.
              <br><br>
              I led design in our team of four interns (1 design, 1 product, 2 engineers), but also conducted user
              research with my team. We were guided by three Innovation Team managers.
              <br><br>
              This was presented to and approved by two GMs in August 2019.

              Only 1 of the 34 customers we interviewed used a dashcam. 7 indicated interest but felt aftermarket

              Here I downplayed contextual sensitivity. Situations could be simple: driving versus parking. Or more
