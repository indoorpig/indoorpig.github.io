              In 2016, Mercedes-Benz began its dive into future connected car services. In the years since, they still lack products that focus on user needs.

              Mercedes-Benz’s vision of the future revolves around CASE — Connected, Autonomous, Shared Services, Electric.
              <br><br>
              As a result, a team pitched the idea of using inactive cameras of select models.* This idea gained traction but lacked a team to investigate further.
              <br><br>
              Most importantly: there was no clear need that a camera system would address. What problem would this service solve?

              Our Innovation Team stepped in to deliver a product concept using onboard cameras and create meaningful impact for drivers.
              <br><br>
              We had a timeline of 3 weeks to create technical and design prototypes. Our goal was to get our concept approved and funded by a GM to continue development and testing.

              I led UX design in our team of four interns (1 design, 1 product, 2 developers) and facilitated the process of synthesizing research into product strategy.
              <br><br>
              I conducted user research along with my team, injecting a design perspective into an organization which lacked this point-of-view.
              <br><br>
              We were guided by the three full-time Innovation Team members — David Owen specifically helped formulate design choices.
              <br><br>
              This project successfully gained approval of two GMs in August 2019. The project is ongoing based on our work.

            <p>
              The Innovation Hub team was created on the basis of finding authentic user needs and addressing them. Our process reflected this principle.
              <br><br>
              While it seemed natural to start with our eventual concept of a monitoring product, our concept was forged through user research.
              <br><br>
              In particular, the examination of driver relationships with their cars revealed insights into the desires of users.

              Diving into the driver-car dynamic highlighted differences between what drivers say and what they do.
              <br><br>
              When asked explicitly, drivers reported no anxiety about the risk of their cars getting damaged. Drivers seemed apathetic or downright dismissive about monitoring their cars.
              <br><br>
              Yet small behavioral inconsistencies popped up through certain user interviews:

              Drivers were taking small actions to limit incidents — with limited effectiveness. Of course they understood there were factors beyond their control.
              <br><br>
              But major painpoints were occurring when drivers had no sense of agency at all — a complete lack of control in situations where they <em>expected</em> some sort of recourse.

              Context of driving and parking mattered too, affecting driver decision-making and how painpoints manifested. Four major areas were identified:

              Drivers don’t think they need security because of the high barrier for entry with aftersales solutions. They preferred taking the risk of their car getting damaged.
              <br><br>
              At the same time, drivers want more control over the safety of their vehicles. Mixed-success coping methods to avoid damage were evidence of this.

              But ultimately if incidents occurred, drivers had no options, amplifying already negative experiences into a mini-crises.

              Our Innovation team was particularly interested in reducing confirmation bias. Documenting assumptions helped prevent hindsight bias and framing the content of our user interviews.
              <br><br>
              Before organizing user research, we documented expected areas of opportunity for onboard cameras, situations in which drivers may utilize them, and the types of drivers that might use them.

              Our team talked to 20 drivers across 2 days. Our team used strategies (developed by the Center for Deliberate Innovation, formerly Flashpoint, at Georgia Tech) to avoid bias.
              <br><br>
              The goal was to investigate driver-car relationships. Cues like car nicknames (e.g. Jerald the Jeep), preferred parking spots, and other personal rituals grounded real behavior patterns, as opposed to self-perceptions.
              <br><br>
              Precise wording mattered. We designed each question to reveal an area of interest. In turn, each of these led to a greater insight into user needs.

            <p>
              At the end of the first week, I designed and led a team workshop. The goal was to transform qualitative data into an initial snapshot of users. We could then stress-test this with more research.
              <br><br>
              I emphasized the dangers of creating overly detailed personas too early. And to be more inclusive in our product, I pushed our team to view personas as spectrums rather than as unique identifiers.
              <br><br>
              I ran affinity mapping to sort persona types. 3 dynamics were identified:
              <ol type="1">
                <li>Comfortable Drivers vs. Anxious Drivers</li>
                <li>Driving for Leisure vs. Daily Drivers</li>
                <li>Alert Drivers vs. Distracted Drivers</li>
              </ol>
              We documented each persona type’s needs and our assumptions about them. To wrap up, we ran a quick ideation activity.

              Over the next 2 days, we talked to another 14 drivers. We investigated confusing nuances and unknowns from the previous workshop.
              <br><br>
              Afterwards we met again for another workshop. We folded in the new research, survey, and qualitative data for a better snapshot. This led to a number of tweaks and added a new dynamic:

              We re-shuffled persona types with this new information. We matched possible situations (car got dinged) and contexts (Trader Joe’s parking lot) with each persona group while using situation - motivation - outcome mapping.
              <br><br>
              These exercises helped highlight 2 groups with compelling user stories that we determined to be our target customers:

              But there was a larger problem I downplayed: contextual sensitivity. Driver mental models and concerns were framed around their situational relationship to their car at a given moment.
              <br><br>
              Those situations could be simple: driving versus parking. Or more granular: parking in a garage versus the street. Even more granular: how often drivers park on a given street.
              <br><br>
              I missed the mark in the nuance of driver expectations in specific situations; the design needed to accommodate for the complexity. In the next few iterations:
              <ul>
                <li>I split the dashboard into distinct “Park” and “Drive” modes.</li>

              Heading into the final days of the sprint, I implemented a cohesive visual design, moving away from the standardized MB app designs for internal reasons.
              <br><br>
              Visuals were focused on the Visionary theme of shedding light onto the dark, creating high contrast between dark tones and sparse highlights. As a result, the metallic, silver theme of MB was allowed to “shine.”
              <br><br>
              Small visual details like the car silhouette subtly indicated user-specific details like the model of the paired car. A new icon set helped define features. Sparse color was used — blue for highlighted status information or yellow

              At the end of our three weeks, I didn’t have nearly as much time as I wanted to test my prototypes. Clarifying their mental models, especially in more immersive, context-sensitive environments would deliver better ways to design for
              drivers. In particular, I would investigate user mental models for notification pushes, status updates, and sensitivity adjustment.

            <p>
              Content written on my part was not as well thought-out and lacked user feedback. My managers’ dedicated help with copywriting was an improvement, but I believe even more work could be done to clarify different monitoring states and
              actions.

            <p>
              As we get more user feedback, it’s essential to re-evaluate the needs of drivers. The user research we laid out was a cursory 2-week process that only laid a foundation. That work needs validation and heavy refinement from both
              qualitative and quantitative sources.

            <p>
              At MBUSA, I didn’t have a design team. I was lucky to have an incredibly receptive team and manager who had invaluable feedback.
              <br><br>
              Design's value lies in activating a user-centric approach within a multidisciplinary team. Empowering non-designers meant just as much as delivering and evaluating prototypes.
              <br><br>
              Addressing user needs is creating business value.

              Not talking to other related internal stakeholders until midway into the sprint resulted in a pivot. Identify experts and leverage their knowledge to work for your team.
              <br><br>
              Another resource was simply a critical set of eyes; I learned to ask for feedback sooner for in-progress work. Surface-level comments made me rethink deeper underlying issues.

            <p>
              Throughout the process I pushed hard for user needs, defending positions during team meetings and frequently adjusting between iterations. Even though my research wasn’t bulletproof, each small design decision was justifiable through it.
              <br><br>
              It was important to realize that snapshots of users could change drastically. That required rapidly adjusting to the new circumstances — but fighting just as hard for that new user.
