              Mercedes-Benz’s future vision revolves around CASE — Connected, Autonomous, Shared Services,
              Electric.
              <br><br>
              Our Innovation team was tasked with finding a digital product use for hardware within select models. This
              project lacked specific users or problems in mind at the start of our project.

              We had a timeline of 3 weeks to create an MVP. The concept would be a success if approved and
              funded by a GM to continue product development.
              <br><br>
              I led design in our team of four interns (1 design, 1 product, 2 engineers), but also conducted user
              research with my team. We were guided by three Innovation Team managers.
              <br><br>
              This was presented to and approved by two GMs in August 2019.

              At the end of the first week, I designed and led a team workshop. The goal was to transform qualitative
              data into an initial snapshot of users. We could then stress-test this with more research.
              <br><br>
              I emphasized the dangers of creating overly detailed personas too early. And to be more inclusive in our
              product, I pushed our team to view personas as spectrums rather than as unique identifiers.

              To start, I had to set driver motivations on a behavioral level. The basis for this came from existing
              behaviors drivers were already exhibiting, as highlighted in journey maps:

              But there was a larger problem I downplayed: contextual sensitivity. Driver mental models and concerns
              were framed around their situational relationship to their car at a given moment.
              <br><br>
              Those situations could be simple: driving versus parking. Or more granular: parking in a garage versus the
              street. Even more granular: how often drivers park on a given street.
              <br><br>
              I missed the mark in the nuance of driver expectations in specific situations; the design needed to
              accommodate for the complexity. In the next few iterations:
            <ul>
              <li>I split the dashboard into distinct “Park” and “Drive” modes.</li>
              <li>I fleshed out the sensitivity of parking modes.</li>
              <li>I re-framed the event log and video library together as post-hoc, reviewing actions.</li>

              Heading into the final days of the sprint, I implemented a cohesive visual design, moving away from the
              standardized MB app designs for internal reasons.
              <br><br>
              Visuals were focused on the Visionary theme of shedding light onto the dark, creating high contrast
              between dark tones and sparse highlights. As a result, the metallic, silver theme of MB was allowed to
              “shine.”
              <br><br>
              Small visual details like the car silhouette subtly indicated user-specific details like the model of the
              paired car. A new icon set helped define features. Sparse color was used — blue for highlighted status
              information or yellow
              destructive/warning indications.

              Alternatively the Park interface’s hierarchy emphasizes monitoring sensitivity and status updates. Drivers

              Design's value lies in activating a user-centric approach within a multidisciplinary team. Empowering
              non-designers meant just as much as delivering and evaluating prototypes.

              It was important to realize that snapshots of users could change drastically. That required rapidly
              adjusting to the new circumstances — but fighting just as hard for that new user.
