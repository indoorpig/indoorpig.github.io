              Mercedes-Benz’s future vision revolves around CASE — Connected, Autonomous, Shared Services,

              Our Innovation team was tasked with finding a digital product use for hardware within select
              models, but this lacked a specific user or problem.

              We had 3 weeks to create an MVP that would be reviewed by a GM and potentially be approved
              to continue product development.
              <br><br>
              I led design in our team of four interns (1 design, 1 product, 2 engineers), but also conducted user
              research with my team. We were guided by three Innovation Team managers.
              <br><br>
              This was presented to and approved by two GMs in August 2019.

              However, I downplayed contextual sensitivity. Situations could be simple: driving versus parking. Or more
              granular: covered versus street parking. Or even more granular: which street, what time.

              Existing designs missed the nuance of driver expectations in specific situations. In response, the next
