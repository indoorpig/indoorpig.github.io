              MB makes great cars. But transportation has already evolved. 
              <br><br>
             The ubiquity of ridesharing and generational definitions of mobility are challenges that MB doesn’t meet as a traditional OEM.

              We had to move past cars; we had to re-learn how users got from place to place.

            <br><br>
            <p>
              We had a simple hypothesis: people need help when leaving from one place to another. Users simply had too many things to worry about in a short period of transition.
              <br><br>
              Our deep dive was into one specific moment: not the commute itself, but right before it. The preparation of leaving; the transition to the transition.

              Challenges like these centered around too many tasks in a short period. As a result, friction could be defined in 3 general elements:

              Moves are more than just reminders. If a user wants to get coffee before work, they simply set the time they need to leave and create a Move to order coffee.

            Understanding user needs meant deconstructing the definition of mobility into the transition between places.
            <br><br>
            Mornings were commonly shared experiences across commuters and acted as the bounds of our investigation. But these experiences varied depending on user schedules.
            <br><br>
            To account for this, we classified and recruited 30 user interviews into three categories:
            <ol>
              <li>Daily 9-5 Commuters</li>
              <li>Variable or Work-from-Home Commuters</li>

            Through user interviews, we learned commutes weren’t particularly stressful; they were zen spaces for many.
            <br><br>
            Instead, transitions before transitions were more stressful. These were the moments between static states and a commute: the 3 minute scramble of grabbing keys, shutting off the lights, and heading out the door.

          <p>
            On good days, users had just enough time in the morning. But more often than not, they struggled to fulfill all the simple tasks in the morning.
            <br><br>
            Our assumption was that users would reach for help in completing these tasks. Satisfying these would ease transitions, allowing them to kickstart their day: enabling mobility.

          <p>
            Why don’t other solutions work? Current digital assistants perform suitably given user-initiated action — but they weren’t initiating during their mornings.
            <br><br>
            And while other products attempt to carve out new touchpoints (smart speakers in homes, virtual assistants on phones), our advantage were our cars — established touchpoints in their day.

            Our Solution
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            Our solution stemmed from a simple, idealized vision.
            <br><br>
            We proposed an unobtrusive assistant to anticipate and execute tasks centered around context-sensitive triggers.
            <br><br>
            There were several prinicples based from research:
            <ol>
              <li>High extraneous cognitive load meant the solution had to have simple interactions.</li>
              <li>The system must reach out first to capture user attention.</li>
              <li>System prompts must occur within a window of context-sensitivity to be perceived as solving ad hoc needs.</li>
              <li>System prompts outside this window were perceived as additional chores.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </div>

            Break it Down
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            We chose a distinct visual and interaction style that diverged from existing MB products as a test for new customers the brand wasn't capturing.
              <br><br>
            There were two main parts to this system:
            <ol>
              <li>Users create Moves (tasks) to be done.</li>
              <li>Moves are then activated at a specific time (Trigger)</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </div>

            Un-Chore-ify Tasks
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            First, I focused on how users created and managed tasks to be done.
            <br><br>
            Users’ threshold for what they were willing to do in the morning was extremely low. Users lose interest if the system:
            <ul>
              <li>prompted too often</li>
              <li>asked users to do too much at once</li>
              <li>took too much time to complete</li>
            </ul>
            Each morning, users had a list of to-do tasks. Organizing a feed of Moves meant deciding how they were displayed and changed the nature of the interaction. Users saw lists as intimidating first thing in the morning. Instead, the metaphor of cards were seen as “more friendly.”
            <br><br>
            A feed of cards were swiped left and right. Each card is completely ignore-able to further lower the cognitive load. Each card featured limited (max of 2), self-contained actions for a task.
            <br><br>
            Cards only showed up when it required user input. Otherwise, Moves were hidden in the main feed but scheduled. New Moves are created by swiping to the left.

            Simplifying Triggers
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            Next, I needed to simplify triggers — how and when tasks would activate.
            <br><br>
            Timing was essential. Prompts during the right window was perceived as helpful - anything outside of that was annoyance. But having users determine that window meant higher cognitive loads.
            <br><br>
            Instead, I created two windows for tasks: morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) tasks, limiting user decisionm-making.
            <br><br>
            Users can’t create Moves more than a half-day in advance: this was intentional to create faster, on-the-fly interactions. 
            <br><br>
            What we called "Leave Times" solved exact timing issues. Every AM or PM, a card asks when users plan to leave. This determines the exact time of Moves activate.
            <br><br>
            By breaking apart time calculation into two distinct streamlined interactions, we lowered the mental calculus for users.

            Details and Nudges
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p>
            To finish my quick, 1-week prototype, I focused on small details and nudges.
            <br><br>
            For example, completing all Moves and clearing the feed rewarded a micro-interaction of completing the day’s tasks. This touch was received well with users who felt delight in accomplishing something while on the move.
            <br><br>
            I also included an alternative PM color scheme helped visually distinguish the trigger selection. This also helped create a distinct micro-interaction during the Move creation process.
