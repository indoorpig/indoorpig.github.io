              Mercedes-Benz faces a disconnect with a growing population with ubiquitous mobility options. At
              the same time, current customers lack additional service offerings that are becoming increasingly standard
              with rivals.
              <br><br>
              Our team was tasked with exploring this space and how we might facilitate mobility for new and current
              customers.

          <br><br>
          <p>
            We proposed an unobtrusive assistant to anticipate and execute tasks centered around context-sensitive triggers.
            <br><br>
            There were 4 prinicples based from research:
            <ol>
              <li>High extraneous cognitive load meant the solution had to have simple interactions.</li>
              <li>The system must reach out first to capture user attention.</li>
              <li>System prompts must occur within a window of context-sensitivity to be perceived as helpful.</li>
              <li>System prompts outside this window were perceived as bothersome.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

            <p>
              Get testable wireframes ASAP and on the eyeballs of users, on whiteboards or lo-fi. With only one week, I
              had to gather actionable feedback and iterate — fast.

            <br><br>
            <p>
              The idea was that users would share tasks they needed completing. The product processes that task at the
              right time and provides a solution.
              <br><br>
              Visually expressed, tasks took the form of cards. Until needed, cards were archived. When the time came
              for a task to be completed, its card resurfaced — with yes or no actions.
              <br><br>
              Breaking this down, that meant there were two main challenges to be solved:
            <ol>
              <li>Creating Moves (tasks) to be done.</li>
              <li>Activating created Moves at a specific time.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="full-post-width content-1170 center-relative">

            <p>
              First up: easing task creation.
              <br><br>
              Ideally, events are imported from native iOS/Google calendars and translated into possible action items.
              One setting, one permission, no manual input for all future events.
              <br><br>
              Though not ideal, in-app touchpoints needed work. Creating one-off tasks, no matter how streamlined,
              conflicted with research insights. As a result, recurring events were heavily pushed.
              <br><br>

            <p>
              Once created, Moves took the form of cards. Together, cards comprised a feed. Lists were stressful, but a
              stack of cards could be acted on or swiped past; ignored or circled back to.
              <br><br>
              To limit cognitive load, Moves were hidden until action was required.
            </p>

          </div>

          <!-- Users’ threshold for what they were willing to do in the morning was extremely low. Users lose interest if
              the system:
              <ul>
                <li>prompted too often</li>
                <li>asked users to do too much at once</li>
                <li>took too much time to complete</li>
              </ul>
              Each morning, users had a list of to-do tasks. Organizing a feed of Moves meant deciding how they were
              displayed and changed the nature of the interaction. Users saw lists as intimidating first thing in the
              morning. Instead, the metaphor of cards were seen as “more friendly.”
              <br><br>
              A feed of cards were swiped left and right. Each card is completely ignore-able to further lower the
              cognitive load. Each card featured limited (max of 2), self-contained actions for a task.
              <br><br>
              Cards only showed up when it required user input. Otherwise, Moves were hidden in the main feed but
              scheduled. New Moves are created by swiping to the left.

            <br><br>
            <p>
              Next up: triggers, or how and when tasks activate.
              <br><br>
              Data supplied to create Moves was now used for requests. As a demo, my teammate remotely scheduled,
              started, and pre-heated a C300 equipped with Mercedes Me.
              <br><br>
              The same underpinnings allowed for reminders, traffic alerts and ETAs, and third-party services (e.g.
              hailing an Uber). And with provided time, services could be effectively account for wait times.
            </p>

          <!-- Next, I needed to simplify triggers — how and when tasks would activate.
          <br><br>
          Timing was essential. Prompts during the right window was perceived as helpful - anything outside of that
          was annoyance. But having users determine that window meant higher cognitive loads.
          <br><br>
          Instead, I created two windows for tasks: morning (AM) or afternoon (PM) tasks, limiting user
          decisionm-making.
          <br><br>
          Users can’t create Moves more than a half-day in advance: this was intentional to create faster,
          on-the-fly interactions.
          <br><br>
          What we called "Leave Times" solved exact timing issues. Every AM or PM, a card asks when users plan to
          leave. This determines the exact time of Moves activate.
          <br><br>
          By breaking apart time calculation into two distinct streamlined interactions, we lowered the mental
          calculus for users.

            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
              With an evaluation-ready wireframe, I tested prototypes with eight users.
              <br><br>
              Concerns of navigation and basic IA were apparent — but these were actually easy changes. Two
              interesting problems came with Move creation and interactions within the card feed.
              <br><br>
              Creating a single Move was like filling out a form.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="full-post-width content-1170 center-relative">

            <p>
              <br><br>
              There were too many options. Setting time was the main culprit; leaving users to decide the timing of
              events in context was too much of a strain.
              <br><br>
              Just as important, there was a fundamental disconnect between this form-like input and the resulting card
              output. The visual representation itself made it difficult for users to make connections in what they were
              doing.
              <br><br>
              Meanwhile, the feed had major interaction issues.

              Discoverability was a major issue. Initially, research insights revealed users felt lists and schedules
              were overwhelming.
              <br><br>
              The resulting design attempted to remove extraneous information — but it went too far.
              Users couldn't find basic status updates on demand.

              First, the concept of time was re-worked completely. Users are given a single "Leave Time," which
              determined the timing for all Moves in that period.
              <br><br>
              From usability testing, there were two main periods of activity: AM (leaving the house) and
              PM (leaving work).
              <br><br>
              This simplified time calculation for users and optimized user flow.

            <p>
              For Move creation, the major change was linking visual representation of user input vs.
              resulting output. Filling out info was represented on the card itself.
              <br><br>
              This facilitated more error recovery given its step-by-step flow.

            <br><br>
            <p>
              Finally, increasing discoverability on the feed meant introducing a swipe-up menu as a visual cue for
              interaction.
              <br><br>
              This menu listed all in-progress and scheduled Moves with a stripped-down card.
              <br><br>
              In doing so, error recovery was promoted with separate delete and edit options after Moves
              were already scheduled or initiated.

              Scoping problems isn't just wise; it's humility. A three-week sprint can only produce so much. There's
