              Mercedes-Benz faces a disconnect with a growing population equipped with ubiquitous mobility options.
              <br><br>
              At the same time, current customers lack service offerings that are becoming increasingly standard by
              rivals.

              Our team was tasked with exploring this space and how we might facilitate mobility for new and current
              customers.

            We proposed an unobtrusive assistant to anticipate and execute tasks centered around context-sensitive triggers.
            <br><br>
            There were 4 prinicples based from research:
            <ol>
              <li>High extraneous cognitive load meant the solution had to have simple interactions.</li>
              <li>The system must reach out first to capture user attention.</li>
              <li>System prompts must occur within a window of context-sensitivity to be perceived as helpful.</li>
              <li>System prompts outside this window were perceived as bothersome.</li>

              As an experience, users would share tasks they needed completing. In return, the product processes that

              Ideally, events are imported from native iOS/Google calendars and translated into tasks without manual
              input.

              An in-app option was needed, but ran the risk of conflicting with research insights. As a result,
              recurring events were encouraged.

              Moves were shown as cards, which comprise a feed. Cards were a useful design pattern because of their
              casual nature. Lists overwhelm; cards could be dismissed.
              <br><br>
              Moves were hidden until action was required.

          <!-- Users’ threshold for what they were willing to do in the morning was extremely low. Users lose interest if
              the system:
              <ul>
                <li>prompted too often</li>
                <li>asked users to do too much at once</li>
                <li>took too much time to complete</li>
              </ul>
              Each morning, users had a list of to-do tasks. Organizing a feed of Moves meant deciding how they were
              displayed and changed the nature of the interaction. Users saw lists as intimidating first thing in the
              morning. Instead, the metaphor of cards were seen as “more friendly.”
              <br><br>
              A feed of cards were swiped left and right. Each card is completely ignore-able to further lower the
              cognitive load. Each card featured limited (max of 2), self-contained actions for a task.
              <br><br>
              Cards only showed up when it required user input. Otherwise, Moves were hidden in the main feed but
              scheduled. New Moves are created by swiping to the left.

              Moves are then translated to requests. As a demo, my teammate remotely scheduled,

              With an evaluation-ready wireframe, I tested prototypes with eight users.
              <br><br>
              It was clear that creating Moves felt like filling out tax forms.
              <br><br>
              There were too many options, but time was the worst as it forced people to plan and calculate future

              First, timing was re-worked completely. Testing confirmed two main periods of use:
              AM (leaving house) and PM (leaving work).
              <br><br>
              As a result, users are given a single "Leave Time," which determined the timing for all Moves in that
              period - simplifying the entire time calculation process.

              For Move creation, the major change was linking visual representation of user input vs.

              Finally, increasing discoverability on the feed meant introducing a swipe-up menu as a visual cue for
              interaction.
              <br><br>
              This menu listed all in-progress and scheduled Moves with stripped-down cards, each with delete

              Intentionality in design is something I continually strive for. Rules and principles are created
              directly from user insights and feedback.
              <br><br>
              That intentionality impacts not only how well teammates can collaborate, it affects how a product feels.

              Scoping problems isn't just wise; it's humility. A three-week sprint can only produce so much. There's
              only so many people to talk to, so much to learn—and so much your designs can be validated.
              <br><br>
              Designing a sustainable process is often just as valuable as nose-to-the-grindstone work.
